# Project description

Bristly is a personal informatics system that empowers individuals to monitor and understand their gut health through stool tracking. Designed with a focus on users experiencing gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn’s disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Bristly enables the systematic logging of stool-related data including consistency, frequency, and associated symptoms.

By visualising patterns and providing insights into the user’s digestive health, Bristly encourages greater self-awareness and supports users in recognising trends that may indicate flare-ups or deteriorations in health. The platform also facilitates improved communication with healthcare professionals by offering a structured, data-driven narrative of the user’s experiences.

Bristly seeks to reduce the stigma surrounding bowel health and promote stool analysis as a meaningful component of everyday self-care. Ultimately, it aims to contribute to earlier interventions, better disease management, and improved long-term outcomes for individuals living with chronic gut-related conditions. [[1]](#1).
